Temple is closed between 1 pm to 4 pm. 2.Senior citizens can opt for lift facility . Wheel chairs available for physically challenged. 3.Paid Shuttle autos from entrance for those who can't walk ( not very sure. Ask the security or call temple. If you are coming by auto or uber you can ask them to drop up the hill they will allow without parking fee. If you have a private vehicle it's very good. Nevertheless it's a good exercise for people coming by metro or bus) 4. Direct exit for people not interested in shopping. There is a clear big LED board which shows direction for direct exit. Many people are complaining that you are forced into stalls. Nobody forces. There is an exit and you should just take that. 5. Buying books paraphernalia etc is optional. Again for those who feel it is a commercial shopping complex you can just take lift or walk away from counters. However their books are amazing and very inspiring. 6. Lot of books and things to engage school going kids into God consciousness. 7. Free meal everyday 11am to 2pm 8. Free Donna (cup) prasada of steaming hot kichidi. You can ask for any number they don't mind. 9. Weekdays you can have peaceful darshan for a longer time 10. You can buy tickets for a queue free closer darshan 11. Clean toilet facilities provided backside of temple 12. All prasadam ( pastries puffs) items are free of onion garlic and eggs obviously 13. Enquire about events in the temple like youth programs , summer camps etc. If you are interested. 14. On certain festivals like Narsimha jayanthi, panihati etc ( you can get to know thru their website about upcoming festivals) the evenings are marvellous. Must visit festival evenings at 6 30pm usually in the open air theatre. 15. Observe the way the Deities are decorated. I am sure no temple in Bangalore have such nice outfits and such decoration for deities that too EVERYDAY. 16. Car park, Guest house, Higher taste restaurant, animated movie Little Krishna shows, pooja paraphernalia, authentic books based on Scriptures, coloring books, kids books, school stuff, bakery... Many more. 17. If you donate even a rupee here, it is completely worth as they spend on free midday meals to school kids all over India.

I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try. And I'm glad that I did. After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it. And then it hit me! This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!! The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it). ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book. There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so. Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing. They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets. There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins. But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry? As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins. Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates). Give this place a try. You will need at least 2-3 hours inside.",4,MIXED,maintained place religious person family heard place happened close staying day decided give place im glad minute place started bothering expect temple put finger hit place clean smell beggar entrance cleanliness associate temple sad face truthtemples clean rotting fruit coconut flower thrown temple peculiar unique smell railway station smell railway station reach iskcon squeaky clean pleasant smell big book constant repetitive droning chant discreetly public address system escape mary lamb thing youll find peaceful divine hurry started driving crazy hour opinion find droning voice soothing big area selling nice poster statuette lovely shirt trinket big walkaround restaurant sell tasty meal reasonable price place clean blame visit management dustbin dumping plate stood bin learn public place clean million year big hurry leave give prasadam tasty give disposable cup eat dump cup place dustbin area clean employeesvolunteers picking discarded food plate give place hour inside,0,2

ISKCON is a very popular destination accessible by Metro, Public transport, Auto,and Cabs, planing to take your car - well there is plenty of parking space. As you enter the huge and sprawling complex - Everything is organized very well. There is an orderly queue system - .after completing the mandatory security check, First you get a darshan of Lord Narasimha followed by a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. Finally you climb to the top of the hill and enter the main temple to view Lord Krishna and Radha. The golden sanctum sanctorum, the marble flooring, the colorful paintings on the walls makes the darshan a great experience. After the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theater or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (egg less of course). And before leaving you can favour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organized. A very important thing to note about ISKCON is its Akshay Patra scheme. ISKCON provides free food to lakhs of school going children as a part of the mid-day meal scheme. The maintenance of kitchen, the cleanliness, use of modern cooking technology and logistics is amazing. If you wish to be a donor or be part of any of their programs you can approach the temple authorities. If you are in Bangalore, make sure you visit ISKCON. You can easily spend a couple of hours in peace, getting the blessings of the Lord Krishna and also having a relaxing time. After the darshan of Lord Krishna and various other temple within the same complex, ISKCON also has vegetarian restaurant, the food served is Sathvik, a very good place for the vegetarians, seating arrangement is good (loved the sofas) and the service is satisfying, calm n peaceful ambience, with bhajans in the background, they have a very good variety in Buffet dinner starting from starters to deserts.

Add to it the chants of Lord's glory echoing through the huge hall having beautiful murals depicting the pass times of Krishna. Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss. One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books. However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple. Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty). However there are many snack items available just before the exit one can buy, like samosa, kachori, rasagola, gulab jamuns, pizza slices, burgers, sandwiches, juice.

To sum it all up its definitely worth a visit if you keep an open mind and enjoy every change in emotion while soaking in the experience and ambience of this place.

One can definitely provide religious literature and books in and around the temple but selling merchandise on multiple counters like market doesn't go well within the temple.

He saw crores of Hindu Bangali of Bangladesh will lose everything and will take shelter in Nadia district of West Bengal and other parts of West Bengal and India and they will be landless, penniless and just like beggars. So, to appease those refugees he decided to take incarnation as sanyasi so that those poor refugees accept his path and become happy. So, all landless refugees will accept Vaishnavism dharma and in performing that dharma, refugees will feel themselves happy and satisfied because rituals, rules and regulations of this dharma will be similar to the condition of their life style. Thus, Lord Vishnu tried to solve refugee problem.God can foresee everything going to happen, so he could see arrival of Britishers in India, their rule, division of India, generation of refugee and fertile area for spreading of Vaishnav dharma. Mayapur was the fertile area because he knew that refugees will assemble around Mayapur area and refugees will be so poor that their life style will be similar to that of a Vaishnav.

On Sundays they have a Family Buffet and we decided to try this out. What an amazing experience. There must have been more than 50 dishes there. Food was prepared very well and the variety "" to die for"". from the number of people waiting in the foyer to come, it appears that this place is a favourite with local people and foreigners. The rooms were very clean and each room opened out into an ""open space"" ( not a balcony) and this is something I really treasured.

The temple is very beautiful and grand. The chants and music are very soothing and calms you down.

The ambiance is very elegant and graceful, but the crowd presence in large numbers, kills the serenity of the place. One apparent and slightly disappointing aspect of the place is that at every spot ( waiting halls, passages leading to the temples, prasad hall, .. . ) there is a visible attempt to market the products and other offerings from the ISKCON establishment.

Mind it, this place, in my opinion has also grown to be more like a business center but the ambiance and location is perfect. Do not eat anything in the canteen or buy any stuff from the temple stores as they are not of very high quality and are usually overpriced. For example I bought some sweets for prasadam and I hoped that since they are made in this special place they must be very pure and good. But I found out opposite. Did not get a very good feel. I also tried the breakfast they serve in the canteen, it is not up to the mark, not at all :( However, I must say that the prasadam (free) you get near the exit, is really really good :) I do not really condemn the business model a lot because this money is eventually used for good purposes like Akshay patra program etc (as far as I know).

So if any of my statements offend someone, my most sincere apologise in advance as if at all, it is unintentional. I have had varied experiences over the years. I have visited this temple from the year 1990 during which it has gone through radical transformation. In the 90s, this used to be a calm lovely place (well which place of Bangalore wasn't!!!) and mostly simplistic which had its serenity about it and a sense of spiritual charge. The reconstruction of the grand temple which stands today has chaged the dynamic of the place for me. It stands tall in structure and imposing in presence, but somehow seems more commercial like most temples in India are turning into. I understand the need to generate revenue for the upkeep, but the diversification into associated businesses seems to be dliuting the spiritual feel of this place as many others. Walking through the sales counters at the end of the circuit feels a bit busy and untemple like. more than a few people come there just to snack and hangout, which is all well, but also contributes to the place feeling like a mall with a temple in there. On another visit my wife was pulled outside the line to be told that she should buy a book for her salvation. This could be an isolated incident by an overenthusiastic volunteer, but it was quite forceful and therefore unpleasant. This also probably happened as she is not Indian. She is fully appreciative of India and its vibrance and follows her understanding of the Hindu principles but she felt forcefully targetted. But it is worth a visit and it still has its nice side. My review is more of what doesnt seem right. So go visit and write your positive experiences.",3,MIXED,start complete believer god respectful faith different section hinduism religion statement offend sincere apologise advance unintentional varied experience year visited temple year radical transformation 90 calm lovely place place bangalore simplistic serenity sense spiritual charge reconstruction grand temple stand today chaged dynamic place stand tall structure imposing presence commercial temple india turning understand generate revenue upkeep diversification associated business dliuting spiritual feel place walking sale counter end circuit feel bit busy untemple snack hangout contributes place feeling mall temple visit wife pulled line told buy book salvation isolated incident overenthusiastic volunteer forceful unpleasant probably happened indian fully appreciative india vibrance understanding hindu principle felt forcefully targetted worth visit nice side review visit write positive experience,0,2

To my eyes, this was an awe-inspiring place and to be honest quiet humbling. During my visit I seemed to be the only Christian westerner amongst a mass of Hindi Pilgrims and lots and lots of VERY smart schoolchildren, obviously taking a visit during term time ? these children seemed to take a great interest in me and were very polite and embraced the opportunity to speak to a guy from England - both, they and their parents and teachers should be proud of them. Its a very peaceful place and I even queued and did the 108 stepping stones with people chanting Hare rama Hare Krishna in each step.

A word of warning about dress code - my shorts were cut just above the knee, and that meant I had to hire a skirt before I could go in. Not a particularly good look - you have been warned!

What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end.

This is one of the main reasons, people love Iscon, in spite of the the fact that temple look very commercialized!

Structure: The entire iscon area is not Green, but completely paved with concrete , granite and marble. Iscon temple is on top of a small hill and hence, if we are going there by public transport (bus), then we have to climb the steps. But if we are on our private vehicles, we can go there with an entry pass (parking), to the top to avoid the climbing. Inside the Temple: Most of the time, there will be a long queue (minimum length of 0.5 Km), until we reach the shrine. The same Queue shall be followed to come out of the temple. The queue to the exit is totally commercialized, making the disciples and visitors walk a longer way until they come out of the temple. All this far, we have options to buy Goodies, sweets, Ayurvedic stuffs, and other souvenirs. The disciples and priests are well behaved and down to earth people, which is one point to be noted. Note: - Mobile phones with Camera and Cameras are not allowed inside the temple. There is also Frisking as in airport where we need to even declare these items.

The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop. The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a short sleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon. There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded. There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers. Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer. It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness.

1812,1812,3375,Trip Advisor,Krishnaa0205,9/11/2016,September,2016,"Amazing, awe-inspiring, humbling Temple, the architecture, the location, fountains, view etc","ISKCON Temple: It is one of the most popular temples, particularly of the recent past. It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines. On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple. The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering. When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days. You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route. When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine. You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple. The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees. There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc. Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships. At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence. You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program. While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.",5,POSITIVE,iskcon temple popular temple particularly recent past top quality management manages temple professional line normal day find crowd entering gate drive till entrance temple temple located hillyland area aprox acre hill transformed amazing temple effort temple committee incorporates wonderful synthesis fusion traditional temple architecture modern principle construction civil engineering access temple premise foot initially reach footwear leaving place deposit footwear walk actual temple environs notice pathway protected rain hot sun special day entrance sri prahlada narasimha swamy temple faced option rounded step enjoy charm reciting hare krishna mahamantra step waiting queue move forward enjoyable experience relished alternately bypass direct route short time sri prahlada narasimha swamy temple side route enter sh laxmi narasimha swamy temple struck awesome beauty amazing sculpture work deity stare eternity lost spiritual ecstasy life move crowd glimpse lord usher temple remember pay obeisanceworship deity garudadeva shri hanuman side entrance narasimha shrine entrance shri srinivasa govinda temple mesmerized outstanding fineness excellence sculpture work feel magically suddenly tranlocated tirupati enjoy reverberation govinda govinda head temple vast hall level accessed wide step banister beautiful gold plated altar attractive interior design ceiling huge painting held roof depicting pastime lord krishna devotee round internal balcony view temple sanctum sanctorum add glamour beauty place bird eye view festivity crowd spilling street kilometer long occassions janmashtami everyday thousand devotee part india country visit temple seek blessing lordship temple bewitched extraordinary beauty presiding deity temple sri radha krishnachandra sri krishna balarama sri nitai gauranga sri nityananda prabhu sri chaitanya mahaprabhu prayed lordship heart content remember offer respect beautiful bronze sculpture srila prabhupada peacefully witness going temple guide divine presence endless row book srila devotee available sale possible opportunity contribute life membership iskcon feed million child school akshaya patre endless supply food originally lord surya sun god yudhishtira pandava king program thing soak mind body back planet earth head exit find lot shop sale point type devotional stuff vegetable eatery available satiate taste bud check hurry move location itinerary head straight higher taste restaurant premise eat king courtier review separately higher taste restaurant,3,0

After the Pooja, visitors and devotees receive 'prasadam' in a leaf cup. And at the exit, you will find plenty of opportunities to buy gadgets, souvenirs, sweets, books.

You gotta keep moving. The other thing that is a huge turn off, is it seems like a business- as soon as you make your way through and get to the big room at the top, they have floors of stalls and tables and people aggressively trying to sell you things. I did buy a CD of the chanting, and it is beautiful and was super cheap.

Love this temple a lot. ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times. The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue. Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes. Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat.

This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place. It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt. Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products. There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious.

With this special entry you can walk through all levels easily with no line up. I recommend to pay the special entry, at each level your entrance will be much more easier and you get closer to the scene as well. At the end you get a few gifts from the temple. 3- Far from the Bangalore center. But if you are planning to go to the Orion mall then it is a good plan to visit this place and then go to the mall which is close to the temple. 4- I couldn't have a nice view to the façade because of some constructions was going on. So somehow I missed the nice view of the temple. 5- it is a culture place as well, like many other places in India. Also they provide free food to those in need.

If you are a visitor to India I do suggest hiring a reliable driver even if it's just the cab driver you've already ridden with, as leaving this place is could be a potential nightmare of confusion, as other reviewers have claimed. I am not a person who meditates, and had I known this was a Hare Kishna temple before I arrived, I might not have agreed to go. But immediately upon arrival I was so moved by the beauty of this temple, which increased as we moved up the many steps through various stages of ritual and observations, that I was completely captivated (in the good sense of the word). At every step it's a rather busy and bustling place, but at the top I chose to sit down on the floor, close my eyes, and try to be silent and still my mind. Suddenly about twenty minutes later my host lightly tapped me on the shoulder and suggested it might be time for us to start heading back. Those twenty minutes for me had flown by in an instant. I think I could have sat there another hour or two, and again, I am NOT someone who would normally do that. I would definitely go back, as there is plenty to see along the way up -- beautiful carvings and monumental architecture. And on leaving, we were handed a portion of rice spiced with some amazing combination of spices that I wish I could duplicate at home. I suspect it was cardomam, cinnamon and maybe cloves, but alas, I have been unable to replicate it at home. Until you have visited it is hard to really describe the magic of this place.

For the first time when i went there i was excited and blindly devoted because i have always loved to visit temples , the peace that i get in the chanting of manthras and the smell of Agarbathis and Camphor and not to leave behind the very structures of the idols and the temples have mesmerized me and continue to do so. now coming to Iskcon. The whole of Iskcon temple is like a MALL meant for shopping and looking around. The priests look and talk like they have everyday meeting with Lord Krishna and only they are the rightful devotees of Krishna. Apart from that they treat you like school kids with discipline routines like chanting while getting into the temple. The idols within Iskcon are like showcase material and i would not recommend anyone who is expecting a peaceful retreat of a temple at this complex.

However it really got more and more commercialized and I meanwhile feel the overdo the commerce inside of the temple. The temple is impressive, but the guys selling the books next to the are where the prayers are done disturb the procedure from my point of view. It is good to know that the money spent is used for the poor to provide poor kids with meals, but at the same time quite some amount is also used to built further impressive temples. If at the end this helps the poor it is fine. The gold statues inside are really impressive. If you go there as a foreigner, note that cameras inside are not allowed (once I was allowed to take it with me, once I had to leave it with the driver - so you need to have trust in your Rikshaw driver). Same applies for shoes, you either leave it outside of the temple or with the driver as inside people are only allowed to walk with bare foot. The temple even provides some free meal. Be cautious as it can be quite spicy. I usually buy some souvenirs or scents at the temple, things are reasonably priced, so there you do not get cheated and you can make a bargain on some items while supporting the temple and the poor. I would anybody also recommend to visit the Shiv Mandir temple next to the Leela Hotel on Old Airport Road. It provides a nicer spiritual experience.

Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? ) After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle. The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters.

Many festivals associated with Lord Vishnu and his avatars are celebrated here with aplomb. There is also a daily schedule of aarti and Gita recitation. I went with my parents to this temple when they visited Bangalore, and they loved the place. Usually there is always long queue to enter the temple. However, the place is well organised and the queue moves fast. By taking a bridge and a flight of stairs, you will reach the entrance of the main temple. The temple boasts of gold plated flagpost and kalash at the top. The environment of the main temple is serene and peaceful. There are idols of the deities - Radha, Krishna and Balrama. In the hall, there is place in the centre where the people can sit and absorb the surrounding. We sat for around 1 hour here. Once you have the darshan and pass along, you will find lits of stalls selling the puja items, books, idols and gift items. This will lead to the canteen, which is 100% veg and has very good items in the menu. There is also a restaurant if you go down.

Though it was rather busy with visitors, I could feel the peacefulness of the temple with the chant and smell of incents. I stayed in the main hall to do a meditation as well as observing other visitors. On the way out, I was rather surprised on the numbers of things to sell for visitors. None could resist the temptation to buy something. Though I normally I don't buy things, but I was so much tempted to try some sweets and delicacies. Most of them are way to sweet for me. My suggestion is really to find the one that suits you well.

The gold plated sides of the main altar with its intricate carvings is eye catching. The very high ceilings with paintings conveying the story of Lord Krishna is superb. One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages. There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out. A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost).

You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due diligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge.

The temple is not only well maintained but also well organised. Also you wont have any problems of any sort of request for offerings from the priests. They are well prepared if there is a rush. There is a big space allocated for keeping shoes and belongings. However if girls are going sleeveless then they will have to purchase/rent a shawl type stole, since the dress code is strict. Once you are inside the temple, taking of photographs is prohibited. Before entering the main temple of Krishna, you will be visiting the smaller temples of Shri Narasimha and Shri Venkatesh. Before entering the main temple, do look around from the top since the view is splendid (if you during a festival you might see fireworks which are awesome). The view is comparable to that of Birla Mandir in Hyderabad. Inside the temple there is a big hall with very nice paintings/carvings on the roof. The main temple has three chambers of deities. Everything is well managed and the Darshan is in a linear fashion. After the darshan in a line, you can sit in the specified place in front of the main chambers. Thereafter you will be going out the exit with various stalls of religious books and the volunteers will enlighten you on their programs if you are interested to go forward with it. After the exit downwards, you will get various shops of things to buy or eat. Thereafter before going to the fountain area you will get Prasadam. You can take a few pics in the fountain area where from the main temple is in view. After wards you can exit and at the exit there is a restaurant if you would like to eat.

Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice. Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US).

On a Sunny day this could be a tad tiring. To start with, they have a very good arrangement of securing your slippers in. You can also opt for a locker where you can secure your valuables though i prefer not to carry any except a mobile phone (which is almost a body part these days) which also needs to be secured in a locker. You have to climb some steps to reach the top of the hill, where main abode, the hall for Krishna temple, Bhajans and meditation are all there. The first feeling is like a WOW!!! You can feel the bliss and the energy of all like minded people doing one thing - Praying and some trying to connect to inner self. Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases. A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India.

Daarmee heb je met maximaal 6 personen toegang tot de hele tempel en word je om de rijen heen geleid. En rijen waren er. Na twee kleinere tempels kom je terecht in wat ik de hoofdtempel zou noemen. Wie in de rij gestaan heeft is nu eindelijk bij zijn doel aangekomen. Wij werden verwezen naar een wachtruimte en verzocht te gaan zitten. Uiteindelijk stonden we vlak voor het altaar. Priesters voerden daar een ritueel op en daarna kregen we een bloem voor achter het oor. Ondanks dat ik weinig van de religie weet een indrukwekkende ervaring. Minder vond ik wat daarna kwam. Niet de uitleg van wat Hare Krishna nu inhoudt, maar wel de enorme hoeveelheid stands met Merchandise. Menig professionele voetbalclub zou er wat van kunnen leren. Zelf ben ik nog opgevoed met het beeld van Jezus die de handelaren de tempel uit sloeg... De opbrengst schijnt wel naar een goed doel te gaan. Maar de ""gemiddeld"" is er een uitvloeisel van.

The family consists of strong believers, not so 'strong' ones, moderately devout and pure touristas! ( as all families consist!) But all of us enjoyed the outing . There are elaborate arrangements for storage of your footwear and an ingenious system for washing the feet of the devotees as you walk in... The architectural marvel is right in the heart of the city. For the devout, there is definitely the ""presence"" the ambiance of the Supreme Being, amidst all the hustle and bustle of the crowd and the some-what un-subtle commercialization. If you are going because you are a firm devotee, please select a less crowded time like early mornings or afternoons, certainly not evenings in the week end.. There is a separate circuit for the believers, where you move from step to step chanting the prayer, which is moving and thought provoking, if you have the time. Don't get into that loop if you are there for a quick dekko and exit. There is a VIP darshan, which is not fair to the regular devotees, but alas, a fact of life. Also the commercialization could be made a bit more unobtrusive..... Otherwise we really soaked up the atmosphere and the magnificence and opulence of the deities.

Not aware of its height and so much zig zag lines even for shoes . And that's for that morning when there was not a single person to visit.no rush no people. There can be short cut way to enter the temple when there is no one , like in airports when there is rush on a particular day they stretch the lines in a zigzag long way .but when there is no rush they cut short. We are senior citizens and heart patients but not the security told us ,not any sign of lift there.we were so much exhausted in climbing three floors height long long paths .after reaching so much height we asked some one there about any other way to go down then he told yes there is a lift there. We were very much surprised and felt bad of their carelessness for not thinking of devotees. These stairs and long paths should be used only on festivals.

This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness. I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god. So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly. The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone.

But on weekends It can be a problem, esp whenever festivals are there. You might end up waiting for parking itself. There is a nominal fee for parking. The place can get very crowded during festival days. elders and people with health issues will find it difficult, as they will have to walk for sometime and will need to climb up some steps to get to the main temple.They do have some provision to reduce the number of steps, but cannot avoid that in entirety. The normal entrance is through a small room where you have 108 steps, and you chant ""Hare Rama hare Krishna krishna krishna hare hare"" as you make each step. The main temple have deities of Radha and Krishna. The sanctum sanctorum and deities are covered in gold. There will be always people who will be performing bhajans with musical instruments and you can sit there for some time. The place is highly commercialized, with lots of shops selling souvenirs, photos, vanity items etc...There are many eateries selling snacks and soft drinks. there is a Jain restaurant outside which serves Jain friendly food.
